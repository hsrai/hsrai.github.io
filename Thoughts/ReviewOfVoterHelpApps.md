## Help that won't help

Election commission tries a lot to make voter's experience delightful, and launches apps / services in that direction. But poor execution proves it otherwise.

I (and I am sure many more) wasted time by the using https://lnkd.in/gMG3zfMu to know queue at polling booth from the comfort of home, on getting message "No data found for the selected AC Details and Part Details." in place of actual number of voters in queue.

Also found another similar service, hence duplicate effort, at:

https://lnkd.in/gY37Xb_H

with heading:

Voters can check length of queues at polling booths from home: Punjab CEO

Information Technology was supposed to bring efficiency and optimising the resource utilisation, but such things reflect duplicate efforts with wastage of user's time.

What should we or Government do?

### Review of WhatApp Chatbot

This is dicremitation with users who don't use WhatsApp. Can Governments create barriers for it's citizens that they need to use a particular app (WhatsApp in this case)? 

Fail to understand why Government is promoting a particular app. Users not using WhatsApp has no way to know the queue. Thanks to non-functioning of the app, which made both user and non-users of WhatsApp at par, rather non-whatsapp user saved their time by no trying it ;-) 

My review (as a user) of non-functional app (as you don't get desired information) is:

Start conversation with message:

vote

then select language.

The you get two options:

How would you like to search queue for your booth name?

Please select from the option below ⤵️ :

[Location Wise] [Booth Wise]

Unable to get, why location wise. If person is on location, then he will see queue physically, what he will use app then? Might be to test the accuracy of information.

On selecting [Booth Wise], then you need to go through a list of 23 district (names are in random order, to make it puzzle for the user), and enter number corresponding to the district where you need to vote.

Then you are presented with a list of 14 assembly names (again random order, Oh! My God, where are good frontend developers). On entering the number corresponding to where you need to vote, you are asked to:

Please enter the Booth No/Part No

(To search for part number / Booth Number, please click on below link)
