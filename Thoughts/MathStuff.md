## Inline formula 

Use may use in-line math formula, like $E = x \times c^2$ This formula works great, easy to type, elegent rendered.

## On it's own line

Any non-polynomial mathematical function can be expressed approximately as a series sum of polynomials. The
more terms we add, the closer the resultant equation is to the non-polynomial function. For instance, cos(x)
can be expressed very accurately in the range -0.5 to 0.5 by the series:

$$\cos(x)\approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} $$
