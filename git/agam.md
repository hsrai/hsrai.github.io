### how to add a new line or paragraph 

to start a new line in the same paragraph or a new paragraph entirely  , we can achieve this either by pressing enter  once 
to create a new line or we can also add two spaces in between two words , both of these will create a new line in the same

As for adding a new paragraph we just simply need to add a blank line
